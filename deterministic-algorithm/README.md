# Deterministic algorithm

This program is implemented by deterministic algorithm to solve Rosenbrock function

## Problem

Rosenbrock function:
$$f(x_1, x_2) := 100(x_2 - x_1^2)^2 + (1 - x_1)^2$$

(a) Solve the problem to minimize $f over R^2$ using the steepest descent and Newton’s (unit step, Levenberg–Marquardt, and modified) methods. Start at the point (−1.5, −1). Towards which point do the methods converge? How many iterations are required for the different methods?

(b) (Where) Is f convex? Is the point obtained a global minimum?
