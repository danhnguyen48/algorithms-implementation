# Deterministic algorithm

This program is implemented by deterministic algorithm to solve Rosenbrock function

## Problem

Rosenbrock function:<br>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$f(x_1,&space;x_2)&space;:=&space;100(x_2&space;-&space;x_1^2)^2&space;&plus;&space;(1&space;-&space;x_1)^2$$" title="$$f(x_1, x_2) := 100(x_2 - x_1^2)^2 + (1 - x_1)^2$$" /></div>

(a) Solve the problem to minimize <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$f&space;over&space;\mathbb{R}^2$" title="$f over \mathbb{R}^2$" /> using the steepest descent and Newton’s (unit step, Levenberg–Marquardt, and modified) methods. Start at the point (−1.5, −1). Towards which point do the methods converge? How many iterations are required for the different methods?

(b) (Where) Is f convex? Is the point obtained a global minimum?
